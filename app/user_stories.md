# User Stories

This document defines **what is being built and why**.

Stories are written for clarity, not completeness.

---

## MVP User

As a user,
I want to interact with a clean, simple web interface,
so that I can complete core tasks without confusion.

---

## MVP Capabilities

- View a basic UI
- Trigger a Firebase test write
- See confirmation of success
- Navigate a minimal, branded interface

---

## Post-MVP (Later)

- User accounts
- Saved data views
- Automation
- Scheduling / calendar features
- Advanced workflows

---

## Non-Goals (For Now)

- Power-user features
- Admin dashboards
- Complex permissions
- Performance optimization beyond “works well”

---

## Guiding Principle

If a feature does not support the MVP story,
it should not be built yet.
